    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Genome Indexing:** Takes a reference genome, divides it into small parts, and creates an index.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Partitioning into Small Parts:** Divides the reference genome into fragments of a certain size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating an Index:** Generates an index, which acts as a map or guide for quick retrieval of different genome parts. This index includes information about the positions of unique sequences in the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimizing Search:** The created index speeds up the alignment process by allowing quick location of relevant genome regions, saving time especially when analyzing large datasets.\n",

    "The `fastqc` command is used in bioinformatics for quality control analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quality Control Analysis:** FastQC analyzes the quality of sequencing data to identify potential issues or biases that may affect downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Data:** Takes input files in various formats (e.g., FASTQ) containing sequencing reads generated from experiments like RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, or whole-genome sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis Modules:** FastQC performs various analysis modules to assess different aspects of data quality, including per-base sequence quality, per-sequence quality scores, sequence length distribution, GC content, sequence duplication levels, and overrepresented sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visual Reports:** Generates HTML reports containing summary statistics, graphs, and charts to visualize the quality metrics and identify any anomalies or patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpretation:** Users can interpret the FastQC reports to make informed decisions about data preprocessing steps, such as trimming adapters, filtering low-quality reads, or adjusting sequencing parameters.\n",

    "## Count number of reads per gene\n",

    "### The tool we use : `htseq-count`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `htseq-count` tool is used in bioinformatics for quantifying gene expression from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Counting Reads:** `htseq-count` counts the number of sequencing reads that align to features such as genes or exons in a reference genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Data:** Takes as input aligned reads in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) or BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) format, typically generated by aligners like HISAT2 or STAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Annotation:** Requires a file containing annotations of genomic features, such as gene coordinates in GTF (Gene Transfer Format) or GFF (General Feature Format).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Counting Strategy:** Implements a strategy to assign aligned reads to features based on their alignment coordinates. Reads overlapping multiple features or features with overlapping coordinates can be handled according to specified preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output:** Produces a table or file containing the count of reads aligned to each feature, which can be used for downstream differential expression analysis or other gene expression studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Compatible with Downstream Tools:** The output of `htseq-count` is compatible with various statistical tools and workflows used for differential expression analysis, such as DESeq2 or edgeR.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `htseq-count` is a valuable tool for quantifying gene expression from RNA-seq data, providing researchers with essential data for understanding the transcriptional landscape of biological samples.\n",
